## ü©∫ Doctor Chat & Video Call Integration

### How We Built the Doctor Chat & Video Call System

1. **Real-time Chat:**
   - Used **socket.io-client** in the React frontend for real-time communication with the backend server.
   - The backend manages connections using **Socket.io** (Node.js or Python backend).
   - Each user (doctor or patient) is assigned a unique ID and joined to a private chat room.
   - When a message is sent, it is instantly broadcast to the other party without page reloads.

2. **Video & Audio Calls:**
   - Leveraged **WebRTC** to enable direct video and audio calls between users.
   - Used a library such as **simple-peer** or **peerjs** in the frontend to simplify WebRTC integration with React.
   - Signaling data (offer/answer and ICE candidates) is exchanged via **Socket.io** between users through the server.
   - When a call is initiated, a live video window opens between doctor and patient, with the ability to end the call at any time.

3. **Frontend & Backend Integration:**
   - All messages and call logs are stored in the database via a dedicated API.
   - Connections are secured using JWT or authentication tokens to ensure user privacy.
   - The UI is designed to be simple and user-friendly, supporting emojis and new message notifications.

### Main Libraries & Tools Used
- **socket.io-client**: For real-time chat communication.
- **WebRTC**: For building video and audio calls.
- **simple-peer** or **peerjs**: To simplify WebRTC usage in React.
- **axios**: For API requests to the backend.
- **react-bootstrap** or **styled-components**: For UI design of chat and call windows.
- **emoji-picker-react**: For emoji support in chat.
- **react-icons**: For icons in the UI.
- **Custom CSS**: For chat and video call styling.

### Example Flow
1. The user clicks the "Start Call" button.
2. A WebRTC connection is established between both parties, with signaling handled via Socket.io.
3. A video window appears for both users, enabling direct communication.
4. When the call ends, the connection is closed and the window is dismissed.
